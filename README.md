# No-Touch-System-with-Millis
This repository contains the diagram and the codes to create simple no-touch control to be applied for smart home and office.

## Materials
### Hardware
1. PIR Sensor
2. 5V Solid State Relay module
3. NodeMCU-ESP8266
4. 5V LED (green-colored, for indicator)
5. Resistor 220Ohm
6. 220V LED Lamp (red-colored)

### Software
1. Arduino IDE: The environment for sketching the code of no-touch system
   
## Code File
The file can be downloaded in [LDR_PIR_Kamar_Mandi_Millis.ino](https://github.com/setiawanph/No-Touch-System-with-Millis/blob/main/LDR_PIR_Kamar_Mandi_Millis.ino). The file is based on discussion from Allen Pitts in PIR to Run Blink w/o Delay (https://forum.arduino.cc/t/pir-to-run-blink-w-o-delay/1138438).
